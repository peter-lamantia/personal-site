## General
Hello! I'm Peter. I'm a software developer, cybersecurity architect, photographer, and adrenaline junkie.

## Education
I'm currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Software Engineering at Michigan Technological University, but everyone calls it Tech. Afterwards, I plan on pursuing a master's degree in Cybersecurity.

## Fun stuff
In my free time, I love mountain biking, skiing, and generally shredding the gnar :) I also like to read and explore new technologies. Feel free to drop a line!
